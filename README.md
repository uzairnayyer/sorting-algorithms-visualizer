**Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (Python + Tkinter)**

A modern, interactive Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using Python and Tkinter.
This application helps students and beginners visually understand how sorting algorithms work step by step with real time animations, statistics, and controls.

**Features**

-Beautiful Dark-Themed UI

-Real-time Visualization using animated bars

-Adjustable Speed Control

-Dynamic Array Size

-Generate New Random Arrays

-Live Statistics

-Number of comparisons

-Number of swaps

-Execution time

**Time Complexity Display**

**Start / Stop Sorting Anytime**

**Multithreading for smooth UI performance**

**Supported Algorithms
*Algorithm*	*Time Complexity*
Bubble Sort	O(n²)
Selection Sort	O(n²)
Insertion Sort	O(n²)

Each algorithm is visualized step by step using color coded bars.



**Technologies Used**

Python 3

Tkinter (GUI)

ttk (Modern widgets)

Threading

Time & Random modules
